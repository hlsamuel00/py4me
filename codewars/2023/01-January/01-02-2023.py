# DESCRIPTION:
# Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.

# For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1.

# Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer

def square_digits(num):
    return int(''.join([str(int(digit) ** 2) for digit in str(num) ]))
