# If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

# Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).

# Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

# Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.

# We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this Kata (but not y).

# The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.

# DESCRIPTION:
# Trolls are attacking your comment section!

# A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

# Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

# For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

# Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.
