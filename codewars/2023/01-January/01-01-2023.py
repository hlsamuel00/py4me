# If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

# Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).

# Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

# Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.

# We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this Kata (but not y).

# The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.

# DESCRIPTION:
# Trolls are attacking your comment section!

# A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

# Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

# For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

# Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

def disemvowel(string_):
    return ''.join(re.findall('[^aeiouAEIOU]', string_))

# You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.

# Implement the function which takes an array containing the names of people that like an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples:

# []                                -->  "no one likes this"
# ["Peter"]                         -->  "Peter likes this"
# ["Jacob", "Alex"]                 -->  "Jacob and Alex like this"
# ["Max", "John", "Mark"]           -->  "Max, John and Mark like this"
# ["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"]  -->  "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"
# Note: For 4 or more names, the number in "and 2 others" simply increases.
