# Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

# You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
# Output: 4
# Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
# Output: -1
# Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums.length <= 104
# -104 < nums[i], target < 104
# All the integers in nums are unique.
# nums is sorted in ascending order.

class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: list[int], target: int) -> int:
        return nums.index(target) if target in nums else -1

# You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

# Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

# You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: n = 5, bad = 4
# Output: 4
# Explanation:
# call isBadVersion(3) -> false
# call isBadVersion(5) -> true
# call isBadVersion(4) -> true
# Then 4 is the first bad version.
# Example 2:

# Input: n = 1, bad = 1
# Output: 1
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= bad <= n <= 231 - 1

class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n_end: int, n_start = 1) -> int:
        while n_start < n_end:
            mid = int((n_start + n_end) / 2)
            if isBadVersion(mid): n_end = mid
            else: n_start = mid + 1
        return n_start

# Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

# You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
# Output: 2
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
# Output: 1
# Example 3:

# Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
# Output: 4
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums.length <= 104
# -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
# nums contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.
# -104 <= target <= 104

                if num > target: 
                    idx = nums.index(num) 
                    break
            return idx if type(idx) is int else len(nums)
        else:
            return nums.index(target)
