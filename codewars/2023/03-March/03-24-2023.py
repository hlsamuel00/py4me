# DESCRIPTION:
# Although shapes can be very different by nature, they can be sorted by the size of their area.

# Task:

# Create different shapes that can be part of a sortable list. The sort order is based on the size of their respective areas:
# The area of a Square is the square of its side
# The area of a Rectangle is width multiplied by height
# The area of a Triangle is base multiplied by height divided by 2
# The area of a Circle is the square of its radius multiplied by Ï€
# The area of a CustomShape is given

# The default sort order of a list of shapes is ascending on area size:
# side = 1.1234
# radius = 1.1234
# base = 5
# height = 2

# # All classes must be subclasses of the Shape class

# shapes: List[Shape] = [Square(side), Circle(radius), Triangle(base, height)]
# shapes.sort()
# Use the correct Ï€ constant for your circle area calculations:
# math.pi
