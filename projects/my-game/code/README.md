## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** PyGame, Python, and CSV Reader

I was able to get a good handle on how to utilize PyGame to create a game from scratch. I also got first hand understanding of how OOP actually applies to creating tangible things. This project really challenged my understanding of Python fundamentals as well as understanding how to pass information from one object to another.

## Optimizations
I plan to build out the game, adding levels, characters, and also additional spells. I'd also like to include featured where we introduce character classes and specific attributes that are tied to those classes. This will involve building up on more class inheritance as well as ensuring that the new classes are polymorphic to fit with the current way the character is made.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned a great deal building this project:
  * Object Oriented Programming - I developed a better understanding of how classes create the building blocks for different aspects of the game. 
  * PyGame - THis was my first time utilizing PyGame, but it was easier to grasp than I initially thought. THe documentation was immensely helpful.
  * Documentation!! - This project showed me the importance of documentation and proper file naming. Keeping track of so many aspects of the game highlighted the importance of not only documenting my code, but the importance of reviewing documentation when encountering a new language or framework.
