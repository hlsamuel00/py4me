# Otaku Advisor
Otaku advisor is a script made with python that utilizes the MyAnimeList API to access a variety of anime genres to provide a recommendation of which anime the user should watch next based on how the user answers the questions posed.

## How It's Made:


**Tech used:** Python, MyAnimeList API

This project is still under construction, but I was able to utilize my knowledge of Python to create this. I am working on a way to parse bigger lists of recommendations in an easily accessible way. I learned alot making this script and how to access an external API using Python.

## Optimizations
I plan to incorporate some Machine Learning and AI concepts into this to allow for more of a detailed recommendation based on individual users and their previously watched animes.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned a great deal building this project:
  * API Access - I developed a better sense of how to access external APIs with Python. JavaScript was my first language and I learned how to access APIs through Node.js and Express.js
  * Python Fundamentals - I deployed the expertise I had in Python to make this script and it is in the beginning stages. I look forward to expanding upon it with more knowledge and ML and AI concepts.
